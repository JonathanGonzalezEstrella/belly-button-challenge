# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, revealing that a small number of microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Features

- **Interactive Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in a selected individual.
- **Interactive Bubble Chart**: Shows each sample's OTUs with customizable markers.
- **Demographic Info Panel**: Displays metadata about the selected individual.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Charts and metadata update when a new sample is selected.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the dashboard.
- **samples.json**: The dataset containing the microbial species data.
- **static/js/app.js**: JavaScript code to build the interactive features using D3 and Plotly.
- **static/css/style.css**: (Optional) CSS file for additional styling.
